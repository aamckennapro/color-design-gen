# Another Color Generator
<em>For use in front-end development</em>, this webapp will generate hexcodes, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, and, if applicable, predefined color names. This webapp will provide
users with the ability to view their color palette across many CSS elements, such as text, headings, borders, tables, backgrounds, etc. 

## Goals
- Generate up to 10 colors that work well together, following color theory and communications theory to communicate an idea to the audience. This will require a lot of trial and error, and maybe even the use of an AI to help determine what colors do and do not work well together. The colors shouldn't be completely random as not to have garbage colors. (v0.1.0)
- Figure out how to generate the color codes from the colors (that'll be fun). (v0.1.0)
- Generate a css file with the use of JS (or some library) that changes the colors to be the colors generated by the above goal. (v0.2.0)
- Create a nice front end that shows the colors in a non-developer focused format. (v0.3.0)
